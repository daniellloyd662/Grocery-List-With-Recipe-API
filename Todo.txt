    Dependencies:

            Use intallation page instructions NOT YOUTUBE (Youtube is outdated)

Todo:
    Split updateRecipeIngredients into two functions, one for updating the list of recipes based on search text and another for adding the ingredients of the selected search to the todolist
    Display the search results in a dropdown menu below the search bar
    Add hyperlinks to each search item
    Add button to add each item to the list
    Add magnifying glass icon


    Update CSS


Done:
    Run code asynchronously so that js doesn't add ingredients to todo list before they are pulled from the API
        Solved by using useEffect(()=>{update data here}, [recipeIngredients])

    Add ability to search for recipes
    Update Css
