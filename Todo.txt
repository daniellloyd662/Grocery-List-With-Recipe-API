Todo:
    Add button to add each item to the list
    Update CSS


Done:
    Add magnifying glass icon
    Display the search results in a dropdown menu below the search bar
    Add hyperlinks to each search item
    Run code asynchronously so that js doesn't add ingredients to todo list before they are pulled from the API
        Solved by using useEffect(()=>{update data here}, [recipeIngredients])

    Add ability to search for recipes
    Update Css
