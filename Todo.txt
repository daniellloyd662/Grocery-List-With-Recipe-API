Todo:
    Run code asynchronously so that js doesn't add ingredients to todo list before they are pulled from the API
        updateRecipe(recipeInputText) in form.jsx is the culprit.
        Don't update the ingredients list UNTIL THE REQUEST IS COMPLETED    

    Add ability to search for recipes
    Update Css
    


Done:
